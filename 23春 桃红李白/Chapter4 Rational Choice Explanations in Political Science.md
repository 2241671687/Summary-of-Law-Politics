##Chapter4: Rational Choice Explanations in Political Science

[toc]

RCTs（Rational Choice Theories） 

## Intro

- 1970s 以来理性选择理论对与美国政治学的影响

- 两种分化：
	- Realists：解释，寻找 empirical variants，psychological mechanisms，提供因果解释
	- Instrumentalists：预测

- 本文
	- realist 的立场，比较两个流派
		- 1. 讨论的是 个人/集体 的行为
			1. RCTs有各种各样的变体，decision/game theory
			1. 综合的方法论
			1. RCTs同样在政治理论和政治哲学中发挥作用

## Rational Choice in Political Sciences

- 三个核心的假设

	- **maximize utility**: desires/beliefs and the performed action
	- preference: specific conditons that a set of preferences should fulfil
	- Restrictions: beliefs an agent holds
- intentional action
	- goal-oriented behavior，motivate——desire
	- rank of options
	- 从何而来？
		- theory
		- empirical
- Transitivity and Completeness
	- Transitivity: A>B, B>C -> A>C
	- Completeness: every option can be rank-ordered 
- Two other variants of RCTs
	- under risk
	- under uncertainty
		- Expected utility theory

## Instrumentalim, Realismm and the Explananda of Political Science

- casual explanations
	- empirical and analytical
	- scientific realism -- instrumental-empiricism
- for realists
	- discover new truths, uncover the subtle casual processes and regularities underlying social reality, offer causal explainations
- for instrumentalist-empiricists
	- Operational, generate predictions
	- not individual behaviors, but external constraints
- two kind of explananda
	- behavior of actors— psychological explanations
	- social patterns resulting from the behavior of both kinds of actors— structural 
	- Moderate externalist interpretation

	- 1. social-structural conditions
		1. desires and beliefs
		1. Decision-making capacity
		1. actions
		1. behavior outcome at the microlevel
		1. Aggregation process, impact on social structure
		1. updated social pattern

## Explanations of Individual Behavior and Their Chanllenges

- causal explanations of individual behavior

	- 一个候选人希望通过直接接触选民来帮助竞选

		- desire 他想要赢得选举
		- belief 他认为直接接触选民能够帮助选举取得胜利

	- Challenge

		- Intentions? Difficult to measure
			- Revealed preference theory
				- 经济学的假设，假设一个人的偏好是一致的，通过可观测的行为推断

		- expected utility?
			- people do not maximize their utility
		- relationship between theory and empirical observation

	- SOLUTION

		- a more general theory of action
		- frame selection

## Explaining the Behavior of Collective actors and their Challenges

> In such explanations, the institutional, or more generally, **social context plays a crucial role in bringing about behavior**. In situations in which structural incentives sharply restrict the choice of available options, psychological mechanisms can be **neglected**

- instrumentalist 
	- collective actors

## The Role of Rational Choice Theories in How-Possibly Explanations

- 因果解释重要吗？
	- 不是唯一重要的东西 "native falsificationism"
	- methodology, explanation
	- How-possibly
	- **Mechanism** theory
		- clarifies individual-level causal mechanisms
		- throretically captures the actual aggregation process from individual to social phenomena and back to individual behavior as well as how such behavior is constrained
		- Formulates middle-range theories
		- how theories can be applied 

## Conclusion

>  the debate about the explanatory power of RCTs would benefit from carefully considering the different kinds of explanatory practices that political scientists engage in.
